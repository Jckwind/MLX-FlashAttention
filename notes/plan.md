 You can manually adapt the techniques from SageAttention, like int8 quantization and smoothing, as steps within your FlexAttention implementation in MLX. You're essentially taking the algorithmic ideas and re-implementing them in Metal.

Summary of Your Plan and Research Findings for MLX FlexAttention:

Goal: Implement FlexAttention, a flexible attention mechanism, using highly optimized Metal kernels in MLX, drawing inspiration from FlashAttention and SageAttention.

Key Principles:

    Tiling (from FlashAttention): Divide the input matrices (Q, K, V) into smaller tiles to improve memory locality and performance. Consider 3D tiling if register pressure is a bottleneck.

    Flexible score_mod (Core of FlexAttention): Allow user-defined Python functions to modify attention scores within each tile. Use MLX's JIT compilation to translate these Python functions into Metal kernels dynamically.

    Efficient mask_mod (from FlexAttention): Enable users to define block-level sparsity patterns to skip entire blocks of the attention matrix. Implement a BlockMask and adapt the matmul_kernel for sparse matrix multiplication.

    Per-Block Processing and Smoothing (inspired by SageAttention): Adapt the idea of per-block quantization and smoothing of keys (K) from SageAttention, even without direct int8 quantization, to potentially improve performance or numerical stability in Metal.

    Asynchronous Data Transfers: Overlap data transfer with computation using asynchronous copy operations in Metal and carefully manage synchronization between kernels.

Kernel Breakdown:

    matmul_kernel (Tiled Matrix Multiplication): Your existing tiled matrix multiplication kernel forms the basis. Implement asynchronous data transfers, handle transpositions, and optimize for Metal (including considering 3D tiling).

    score_mod_kernel (JIT-compiled): This kernel, compiled from the user's Python score_mod function, will be executed after matmul_kernel. Careful data transfer and integration are crucial.

    scaling_kernel: Scales the attention scores.

    softmax_kernel (Tiled): Implement an efficient tiled softmax kernel optimized for Metal.

    block_mask_kernel: Generates the BlockMask for mask_mod support.

    Output Calculation Kernel: Computes the final weighted sum.

    Orchestration (Master Kernel or Host-Side): Manage execution and data flow between kernels.

Implementation Strategy:

    Refine matmul_kernel: Complete testing, profiling, and optimization, including asynchronous copies and potential 3D tiling.

    Implement score_mod_kernel Compilation: Focus on the MLX JIT compilation of user-defined score_mod functions and its seamless integration with the matmul_kernel.

    Implement softmax_kernel: Develop an efficient tiled softmax in Metal.

    Integrate Remaining Kernels (scaling, output calculation): Ensure correct data flow and synchronization.

    Implement mask_mod Support (Phase 3): Develop the block_mask_kernel and adapt matmul_kernel for sparse matrix operations.

    Orchestration: Design and implement the kernel orchestration logic.

    Performance Tuning and Benchmarking: Profile, optimize, and benchmark against a standard implementation to measure the performance gains.

Inspiration from SageAttention:

    Adapt the per-block processing concept, exploring tiling strategies.

    Consider smoothing the keys (K), potentially as a pre-processing step.

    Explore reduced precision if supported by MLX.

    Analyze SageAttention's Triton implementation for algorithm structure and data flow ideas, but translate those ideas into Metal and MLX.

By systematically following this plan, leveraging your existing work, and incorporating insights from research, you are on track to develop a high-performance and flexible FlexAttention implementation in MLX. Remember to prioritize thorough testing and profiling at each stage.
